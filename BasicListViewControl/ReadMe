Overview
This assignment will help you continue your exploration of the Java programming language and the Eclipse environment. 
This will help prepare you for the tasks you need to complete when you assume the role of developer in Module Five. 
You will be asked to run an existing program and then make small changes to customize it.

Prompt
To continue your exploration of the Java programming language and the Eclipse environment, you will modify an 
existing program to fulfill a user story. To do this, run the program provided and then make your changes by 
completing the following steps:


Download the SampleListView ZIP file to your computer. Right-click on the folder and select “Extract All…”. 
In the unzipped folder, find and run the BasicListViewControl JAR file. This will allow you to see the template 
before you make customizations.
Import the BasicListViewControl ZIP file to a new project in your Eclipse IDE. For help with importing a ZIP file to 
Eclipse, review the Uploading Files to Eclipse Tutorial Word Document.
Using the source code given, update the simple list to your top five chosen destinations. Include the destination 
title, a short description, and a small image for each. This will help ensure that you have fulfilled the acceptance 
criteria of the user story. Refer to the Developing Basic ListView Control Tutorial to help you with this task.
Add images and additional customizations.
Add images for each destination and at least one additional customization, color scheme, or the like to make the 
control as elaborate as you want. Be sure to include clear and concise comments to explain your changes.

Finally, add a label with your name on it.
